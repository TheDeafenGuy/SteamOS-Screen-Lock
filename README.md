# SteamOS-Screen-Lock
Script to lock SteamOS desktop mode.


In SteamOS desktop mode, by default, there is no button to lock the screen. Although there is no button, it is still possible to lock the screen. The lock.sh file is a script that will lock the desktop, and bring you to the lock screen. If you wish to customize the lock screen, open settings and go to Workspace Behavior -> Screen Locking and then click on appearance. From there, you can set the background that appears when on the lock screen.

Warning: You will need to set a password for the Desktop Mode user before you use my script!

To acomplish this, open Konsole and run the command "passwd" followed by the password you want to set.

Be sure to write down the password you just set, as it may come in handy in the future.

You can now use the lock.sh script that I am providing.
