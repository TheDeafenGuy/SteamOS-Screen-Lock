# SteamOS-Screen-Lock
Script to lock SteamOS desktop mode.


In SteamOS desktop mode, by default, there is no button to lock the screen. Although there is no button, it is still possible to lock the screen. The lock.sh file is a script that will lock the desktop, and bring you to the lock screen. If you wish to customize the lock screen, you will have to search through settings to find it, as I am no longer using SteamOS.
