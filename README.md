# SteamOS-Screen-Lock
Script to lock SteamOS desktop mode.


In SteamOS desktop mode, by default, there is no button to lock the screen. Although there is no button, it is still possible to lock the screen. The application I have created runs the command to lock the desktop, so now you can lock the desktop if you wish to do so. If you wish to customize the lock screen, open settings and go to Workspace Behavior -> Screen Locking and then click on appearance. From there, you can set the background that appears when on the lock screen.

Warning: You will need to set a password for the Desktop Mode user before you use my application!

To acomplish this, open Konsole and run the command "passwd" followed by the password you want to set.

Be sure to write down the password you just set, as it may come in handy in the future.

Note: The next step is only if you are using the .sh file. If you downloaded the application, you do not need to do this.

Also, you will need to make the script executable.
This can be done by opening Konsole and running the following command: chmod +x [INSERT SCRIPT LOCATION HERE]

You can now use the application that I am providing.
